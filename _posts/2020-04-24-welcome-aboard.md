*Although, I have been writing articles for over a year, the motivation of starting a personal blog has finally struck me during the Corona virus lock down. I have been meaning to start this blog for quite a while and I am very excited!*

This inaugural piece of editorial is just here for me to actually start writing content here. So, I am going to start uploading articles about some interesting things here from time-to-time.

The topics I am planning to start off with are a bit broad. I tend to write a lot about science but I try to go off beat once in a while, too. I am going to keep this blog a mixture of everything and start off with a non-science topic. Because after that, there will be science and in good measure, too.

I plan to make some series’ about history and science and I’ll be kicking off with one. And some timely updates like new episodes will be updated soon. Well, to anyone who is reading this, best of luck, you are in for a ride.
